#  What is repo about?
Well I had a interview recently at Samsung [Random-Subsidiary] and I was asked to do some ML algorithms from the scratch without using libraries and that too on paper.
According to that dumb guy If I can't do this I am not qualified to apply for ML Roles.
At the time I am writing this I am interning at 2 places together and managing both of them
- Data Science Intern
- Machine Learning Intern

Both are decently paid internships but according to the 'dumb samsung guy' I don't know anything about ML or maybe I just hurt his ego.

# Topics in this repo
I plan to push algorithms starting from regression to GANs from scratch 

(Once I am done with this I'll send it to the dumb samsung guy)
- Topic 1
- Topic 2
